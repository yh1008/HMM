#### HMM
Hidden Markov model

this is an implementation of using HMM to generate POS tags

algorithm see http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/courses/nlp2011/notes/hmms.pdf page12

#####The program will produce: 
1. a txt file called "prior.txt" that contains the prior table content; 
2. a txt file called "likelihood.txt" that contains the likelihood table content.
3. a txt file called "sys.txt" that contains the POS tagging result (the hardcoded input file is the development.text)
4. I included a sample output file generated by my system, renamed to sampleOutput.txt


#####How to run the program: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. notice the training.pos and development.text has to be in the same directory as this program

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. took 30 mins on department's server/14 mins on a machine with 8G RAM


	$ python HMM.py
